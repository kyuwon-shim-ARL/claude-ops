# Modules Directory

This directory is reserved for domain-specific implementation modules that will be created during task execution.

## Purpose

When you start working on specific tasks using `/task-start <TID>`, the implementation modules for your project will be placed here.

## Example Module Types

Depending on your project domain, you might implement:

- **Data Processing**: `data_collection.py`, `data_preprocessing.py`
- **Analysis**: `statistical_analysis.py`, `machine_learning.py`
- **Bioinformatics**: `alignment.py`, `variant_calling.py`
- **Web Development**: `api_client.py`, `database.py`
- **Scientific Computing**: `simulation.py`, `optimization.py`

## Template State

This directory is currently empty as this is a template repository. Actual implementation files will be created based on your specific project requirements.
