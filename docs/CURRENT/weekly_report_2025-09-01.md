## ⚡ Gap Analysis & Action Plan

### 🚀 START DOING
1. **Implement session clustering** for better organization
   - Command: `/fullcycle "Implement session grouping by project type"`
   - Sprint Points: 8
   - Success Criteria: Group 10+ sessions with <1s switching time

2. **Add predictive monitoring** using session state patterns
   - Command: `/planning "Design ML-based session health prediction"`
   - Sprint Points: 13
   - Success Criteria: 90% accuracy in predicting session issues

3. **Create team workspace features**
   - Command: `/implementation "Multi-user session sharing system"`
   - Sprint Points: 21
   - Success Criteria: 3+ users can collaborate on same session

### 🛑 STOP DOING
1. **Manual error recovery processes**
   - Impact: Saving 2 hours/week
   - Alternative: Automated recovery with `/restart` command

2. **Excessive logging in production**
   - Impact: Reduce log volume by 60%
   - Alternative: Conditional debug logging

### ✅ CONTINUE DOING
1. **Comprehensive error handling**
   - Strength: 0 critical failures in past week
   - Amplification: Apply same pattern to new features

2. **Git-based deployment workflow**
   - Strength: All changes tracked and reversible
   - Maintain: Keep commit quality high

3. **Test-driven bug fixes**
   - Strength: 100% bug resolution rate
   - Sustainability: Maintain test coverage above 90%
