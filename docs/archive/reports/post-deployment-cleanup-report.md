## 🔧 Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. Python Cache Cleanup
```bash
# Removed all Python cache directories and compiled files
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
```

- **Files Cleaned**: All `.pyc` compiled Python files
- **Size Reduction**: Significant reduction in repository bloat

### 2. Documentation Organization
```diff
+ docs/archive/reports/repository-cleanup-report.md
+ docs/archive/reports/deployment-report-2025-09-09.md
- ./repository-cleanup-report.md (moved)
- ./deployment-report-2025-09-09.md (moved)
```

### 3. File System Verification
- ✅ No leftover log files (`.log`)
- ✅ No temporary files (`.tmp`, `.temp`, `.bak`)
- ✅ No coverage artifacts
- ✅ No development cache directories
- ✅ Clean root directory structure
