## 🔧 Technical Changes Deployed

### 1. Repository Organization
```diff
+ docs/archive/analysis-reports/  # Moved analysis documents
+ docs/archive/reports/           # Moved test and weekly reports  
+ repository-cleanup-report.md    # Comprehensive cleanup documentation
~ .gitignore                     # Enhanced with debug patterns
~ scripts/claude-ops.sh          # Updated with latest changes
```

### 2. Notification System Fixes
- **Quiet Completion Detection**: Fixed stability logic to properly detect commands like `git log`, `ls`, `docker images`
- **Prompt Pattern Matching**: Added break logic to prevent double counting of matches
- **State Transition Logic**: Enhanced debugger test to properly simulate WORKING → IDLE transitions

### 3. Test Suite Improvements
- **Before Fix**: 109 passed, 3 failed (96.4% pass rate)
- **After Fix**: 112 passed, 0 failed (100% pass rate)
- **Fixed Tests**:
  - `TestQuietCompletionDetection::test_detect_git_log_completion`
  - `TestNotificationDebugger::test_debugger_detects_missed_notifications`
  - `TestIntegration::test_full_workflow_quiet_completion`
